​Signal Registration: I used the signal() function to register a custom handler, allowing the parent process to react to specific system interrupts instead of terminating immediately.

​Child Process Logic: I used fork() to create two child processes that utilize sleep() and kill() to send signals to the parent at specific time intervals.

​Graceful Exit: The parent process handles each signal differently, performing distinct cleanup actions for SIGTERM before exiting entirely upon receiving SIGINT.

​Process Persistence: I implemented an infinite while(1) loop with a pause() system call to keep the parent process active and waiting for asynchronous signals.

​Compilation: I used the gcc compiler to convert the C source code into an executable file, ensuring it was linked correctly with standard libraries.
