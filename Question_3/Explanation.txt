File Initialization: I created a CSV-style marks.txt file containing student roll numbers, names, and three subject marks to serve as the input for the script.

​Permissions: I used chmod +x to change the file mode, allowing the shell to execute the script directly as an application.

​Looping Logic: I implemented a while read loop with IFS=',' to parse the comma-separated data into individual variables for processing.

​Arithmetic Operations: I used double parentheses (( )) for arithmetic comparisons to determine if each mark was below the passing threshold of 33.

​Categorization: I utilized a counter variable fail_count to track individual failures and conditional if statements to filter students into the requested categories.

​Summary Output: I used echo commands at the end of the script to display the final counts for each student category as required by the prompt.
